  I create a Sale Order to follow
-
  !record {model: sale.order, id: so1}:

  I create a follow-up
-
  !python {model: ir.actions.server}: |
    context = {'active_id':  ref('sales_followup.so1'),
               'active_ids': [ref('sales_followup.so1')]}
    res = self.run(cr, uid, [ref('sales_followup.action_sale_order_follow_up')], context)
    assert res != False, "Error on ir.actions.server launching"
-
  I check the creation of the wizard
-
  !python {model: sale.order.followup}: |
    assert len(self.search(cr, uid, [])) == 1, "Wrong number of created wizard"
-
  I check if the wizard is related to the sale order and if the information is ok
-
  !python {model: sale.order.followup}: |
    wiz_ids = self.search(cr, uid, [])
    for wiz in self.browse(cr, uid, wiz_ids):
        assert wiz.order_id.id == ref('sales_followup.so1'), "The created wizard is not linked to the Sale Order"
        assert wiz.state == 'Quotation', "The state on the wizard is different than the state of the Sale Order"
        assert len(wiz.line_ids) == 3, "Number of lines in the follow-up not corresponding to the number of lines in the sale order"
    self.unlink(cr, uid, wiz_ids)
-
  I confirm the sale order
-
  !workflow {model: sale.order, action: order_confirm, ref: so1}
-
  I create again a wizard
-

    self.unlink(cr, uid, wiz_ids)

  I run the scheduler.

  !function {model: procurement.order, name: run_scheduler}:
    - model: procurement.order
      search: "[]"
