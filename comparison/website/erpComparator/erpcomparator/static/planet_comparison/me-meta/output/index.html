<h4><a href="http://fptiny.blogspot.com/2009/02/open-erp-maintenance-and-migrations.html">Open ERP maintenance and migrations</a></h4>
<div class="entry">
<div >
With the version 5 of Open ERP, we setup a second level maintenance contract, that can complete partner's first level maintenance/support contract provided to customer. It's a service contract (not required to use Open ERP) to get some guarantees and to work on a professional way. In these editions, we provide:<br /><br /><span>bugfixes guarantees</span> : according to the contract level, we guarantee a delay to manage a bug. Within this delay, we assign a full time developer on the bug that will fix it in an average of 4 hours. On previous versions of Open ERP the bugfix was at the charge of the partner (from the support hours in the partner contract). With this new system, partners get an unlimitted and free bugfixes, paid by the final customer. We setup an automated migration system within the server that can automatically download new versions and apply fixes.<br /><br /><span>Life cycle guarantee</span> : with these new editions, we are able to provide up to 5 years of maintenance on a specific version of Open ERP. It's a<br />guarantee for the customer they will not have to migrate at each new version. (nobody likes to be forced to migrate often a working ERP system)<br /><br /><span>Security and bugs alerts</span>: we reviewed all our internal procedures to be able to report to customers (or partners) new security alerts and bugs. We send the report about the security issue or bug with the fix of the problem. The application of the patch or the training of the customer should be provided by partners through their support contract.<br /><br /><span>Automatic Migrations</span>: the maintenance contract include a guarantee on the automatic migrations from one stable version to another stable version. It already works with current 4.2 versions. We provide you the automatic migration system and the service to help you to migrate if needed.<br /><br />Please note that these editions are only services. The Open ERP code used is exactly the same between all editions or for the community. We will always continue to use bazaar and launchpad to push what we do to the community.<br /><br />But I think we can not achieve these 4 services and guarantees without a<br />service contract. The big change with version 5, is that this effort<br />(migration, bugfixing, life cycle guarantees) is not anymore at the charge of the partner but the end-customer.<br /><br />You can compare the different contracts here:<br /><a href="http://openerp.com/index.php?option=com_content&id=8">http://openerp.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;id=8</a><br /><br /><br /><span>More explanation</span><br /><br />In reaction of a post we had on the forum:<br />> So I suggest to find a bettter term for "No guarantee" > "Supported"<br /><br />A 'guarantee' is a service ! The editor can not offer 'support' for free, it's not reliable nor scalable !<br /><br />It does not mean we do not provide the code or bugfix, it's just mean if you want a guarantee you need a maintenance contract. Because a guarantee is a service.<br /><br />We, as an open source editor, want to provide everything for free. As a CEO, that's my business but also my passion. But I consider that a service must be paid. No matter of the form of the service. After, everything we achieved through this service are pushed to the open source community for free, once it's done.<br /><br />We used to work like this for the code, it will be the same for the bugfixes, the maintenance and the migrations. Of course, we continue to have R&amp;D budgets to develop new features and improve the quality. I am just talking here about urgent bugfixes that are part of our SLA.<br /><br />I underdand it's a big change and people do not like the changes. But note that last year, partners where complaining of the invert. Before this, bugfixes requested in an emergency by partners had to be charged in the partner contract. So the reaction was, why should the partner pay to bugfix something.<br /><br />This maintenance contract sets the basis of a strong model where:<br /><ul><li>the partner do not have anything to pay (it's the customer that purchase the maintenance)</li><li>the editor can organise himself and offer a strong and guaranteed quality of services for the different maintenance aspects, because he is paid for this.</li></ul><br />On v4.2, the more we had bugs, the more profit was generated for the editor, because the partners had to pay per hours. (of course, it was not our goal) It was good for the editor but not for the product, nor the partner. That's why we wanted to change this for version 5.<br /><br />With these maintenance contracts, the more bugs we found, the more it costs to the editor ! Because we sell fixed price contracts, no matter of the number of bugs. Trust me, we will organise ourself to provide VERY good code and quality of service. And that's very good for maturity of the product.<br /><br />Now, bugs-migrations-security issues will not cost anything to the partner, so they can control their costs more easily on customers projects.<br /><br />So, the goals of these changes and the version 5 are:<br /><blockquote><br /><span>IT'S TIME TO BE MORE PROFESSIONAL AND RELY ON A STRONG BUSINESS MODEL THAT WILL INCREASE THE QUALITY OF THE PRODUCT AND THE SERVICE, WHILE SUSTAINING THE GROWTH TO DELIVER A BETTER PRODUCT TO THE COMMUNITY.</span></blockquote><br /><br />I have 40 people working on R&amp;D, maintenance, bugfix and partners services. Trust me, the yearly 1950 EUR we charge to partners is ridiculously low according to our editors's charges. Before version 5, the editor was profitable due to customers projects and was loosing lots of money on the editor area.<br /><br />> * we do not migrate to a product which does not support<br />> ** UTF-8 printing (nobody else will migrate and even use V5)<br />> ** UTF-8 document management<br /><br />As I said, you can not ask more and more, for free, to the editor. Most of the time we succeed to provide what partners and the community requests, and we will continue to work like this. But you have to understand we all worked by night to achieve these needs and it's not reliable in the long term. We need a strong business model.<br /><br />You can not request more and more new open source features/modules, while asking free maintenance. It's not reliable nor scalable at all. The solution we proposed, through editions, is very good for everyone:<br /><ul><li>The partner resell and, thus, don't pay for the service (+get a commission)</li><li>The customer get the guarantee and the quality of services he needs</li><li>The editor can start consolidating on quality of services and maintenance because he is paid for this.</li><li>The result of all of this will be pushed to the community to sustain the growth of the product and his quality.</li></ul><br />Otherwise, it's not scalable, nor reliable. We have 15 new modules per month,<br />the maintenance of all these modules become more and more complex. Trust me, it's really complex to achieve to growth we made (in features and in quality),<br />we have 40 very good people behing this.<br /><br />That's why I propose a big change in the business model. If we want to<br />sustain the growth and the quality of the product, we need:<br /><ul><li>A win-win relationship between partners and the editor</li><li>Contracts that allow us to provide unlimitted maintenance &amp; bugfixes</li><li>Push everything that have been paid by the customers to the community</li></ul>I think that these new propositions, for v5, fit perfectly into these<br />needs.<br /><br />> The reaction of my most important - and meanwhile angry - 4.2 client<br />> * you call this free?<br />> * what are they going to charge next year ?<br />> * if ever we migrate we might fund an open source module for migration.<br /><br />1. Yes, it's free like in <span>"free software"</span>, not like in <span>"free beer"</span>.<br />2. Probably the same amount, or less if we have more customers to divide the maintenance costs on. The great advantage of open source is that the customer manage the market. If the offer is too expensive, he can do the work himself. Check at the competitors (Compiere / OpenBravo), they charge 8000 € per year for this service. It's not expensive at all, we have 350 modules to maintain and a fast evolution of the product to control, for 1500€ !<br /><br />I consider the "migration guarantee" as a service. Migrations are very complex to manage. We worked 5 months to manage automated migrations between v4 and v5 and the result is quite good; we automated most of our databases.<br />But I also know that we need to provide a service for this because, either if the scripts are very strong, all databases are different and we may encounter difficulties on some installations.<br /><br />If we release for free, then people may complain it doesn't work in all cases. If we don't sell maintenance, I can not work on a specific (one by one) customer requests. We want to offer quality services and code/product. For maintenance and migration, the only possibility is to assign full time developers on this that will work per customer requests.<br /><br />> The reaction of my most important - and meanwhile angry - 4.2 client<br /><br />If you have a problem with your customer, please understand that we don't guaranteed nor sold any maintenance nor support contract to your customer. You probably did it, not me !<br /><br />I understand it's a very confusing situation for you. But the new maintenance contract have been setup to avoid this in the future. What we did with this V5 is to avoid such situation and provide the service you need to take everything at our charge, spreading the cost to the global number of customers.<br /><br />> Automated migrations must be available to the community<br /><br />I fully agree with you ! Migrations must be available to the community.<br /><br />But I also consider migrations guarantee as a service and a big cost to<br />GUARANTEE this in the future. So I thought about a mix to satisfy customers (that need guarantee, quality, quick and direct services) and the community that want to migrate for free.<br /><br />That's why I think migrations should be seen like the 'Shared Funding Projects':<br /><ul><li>Those that needs a professional environment, a guarantee on the quality of services and code, have to purchase the maintenance contract.</li><li>When the maintenances contracts reimbursed the R&amp;D costs of these migrations, we will publish them as open source for the community.</li></ul><br />So, I estimated that we will be able to release the migration scripts with 3 to 8 months, according to the success of the editions. If it takes more than 8 months, I will take the costs at my charge and distribute everything online for free. So that the community have a 'guarantee' on waiting maximum 8 months.<br /><br />This remark is only for migrations scripts and shared funding projects. For all the rest (new developments, bugfixes, ...) we push what we develop directly on launcphad.</div>

This post explains all the changes that are related to this new version: partnerships, migrations, new features, etc.<br /><br /><span>About the Software</span><br /><br /><br />I suppose you already know most of the changes that have been applied in the Open ERP software. This new version focused on the following elements:<br /><ul><li><span>ACCESSIBILITY &amp; EASE OF USE</span> : the version comes with tooltips on most fields, a complete documentation (1500 pages) linked with contextual help, configuration wizards, pre-configured access-rights, reviewed interfaces, simple/extended mode. This should allow people to start working with Open ERP much more easily.</li><li><span>BETTER INTERFACE</span>: especially with the web client with the drag&amp;drop calendar, the gantt charts, the process view, reviewed look, better dashboards, etc.</li><li><span>TOOLS FOR INTEGRATORS</span>: to allow you to integrate Open ERP by doing parametrization, not develoment: screen/object designer, server actions, workflow editor, etc.</li><li><span>MATURITY</span>: about 1200 bugs have been fixed within the past 5 months.</li></ul>And, of course lots of new modules and features.<br /><br /><span><span>About the marketing</span></span><br /><br /><br />We splitted the (allinone) Open ERP website into two websites, to target different kind of users:<br /><ul><li>Open ERP : for customers, to promote a product or a solution. You will find on this website: features, online demonstration, success stories, services offers.</li><li>Open Object : for the community, to organise collaborative efforts. New things on this website: irc channel, extensive launchpad use, technical keypoints.</li></ul><br />These websites are all related to the same code/software. We can say that:<br /><ul><li>Open ERP is a product</li><li>Open Object is a project</li><li>On Demand is a service</li></ul><br />We think it's important to have a different communication according to the target market. Customers will want to see advantages, ROI, services offers, success stories whereas community will want to see forum, IRC, current bugs, branches of development, ...<br /><br />We also launched new services:<br /><ul><li>OpenERP.tv : a place for the community where you can upload your screencasts You can post your blog on blip.tv with the tag openerp, and we will validate it to integrate in the screencasts section.</li><li>Evaluation-Matrix.com : A pragmatic and collaborative comparison amongst most advanced ERP on the market.</li><li>Doc.OpenERP.com : a 1500 pages of documentation with the following books available: enterprise management (The Open ERP book), the community book, the installation book, the BI book, the modules list, the features list.</li></ul><br />We splitted the planet into 2 planet, the goal is to allow every partner to contribute on the openobject planet: technical issues, new modules, customers, announce of events, ... The communication for the Open ERP planet will be done by our marketing team by reviewing, improving and filtering others contents.<br /><br /><br /><span>About the partnership</span><br /><br />The partnership contract has been changed to be more reliable. We kept the same ideas than the preceeding contract but improved on some points, mainly the point (units) system.<br /><br />We simplifed the unit system to be much more easy and understandable. We got inspired by the ezPublish model. Now, units are computed based on all services you resell to your customer (or buy yourself), making a certified module, maintenance contracts, trainings, etc. This points system is the reflect on your activity on Open ERP:<br /><ul><li>reselled maintenance contract => number of customers</li><li>quality certified modules => number of good modules published</li><li>trainings &amp; support => your knowledge on Open ERP</li></ul><br />This new contract will take effect at the end of your current contract. Please note that we will be more strict with the partner level: sliver/gold. We will review the partnership level every 3 months, based on your real activity. So, people may increse their level/decrease their level according to their real activity on Open ERP in 6 months. Our goal is to be very fair and apply exactly the same rule to everyone.<br /><br />The new rule to be starter/silver/gold/platinium are:<br /><ul><li>Platinium : 5% of the top partners having the most points</li><li>Gold : 15% of the top partners having the most points</li><li>Silver : partners having more than 1500 points</li><li>Starter : new partners</li></ul>It's better because it scale efficiently with the growth of the partner network. We also re-evaluate partners level once every months.<br /><br />In this situation, the partner level is less related to the amount the partner purchase but more to the activity and sales the partner generates.<br /><br />The commission on all our products (maintenance, trainings, ...) has changed too:<br /><ul><li>before it was 20% on all our products</li><li>we increased to 25% splitted like this: 15% direct discount, 10% to be reused to buy others products (maintenance contracts, support, trainings, ...)</li></ul><br />The commission is applied on direct purchases, or on purchases made by your customer. If one of your customer buys directly the service on our online shop, contact us to say it's your customer and we will pay you the commission at the end of the month.<br /><br /><br /><span>About the module certification</span><br /><br />In version 4.2, we had lots of troubles due to the quality of the modules published. Some where not fully finnished (proof of concepts), some where made by contributors and not maintained efficiently, ... It was a bad image for the product. We also get requests from customers and partners to get evaluation and feedback on their own modules.<br /><br />The certification is based on a procedure of 150 technical and functionnal tests and reviewed by 2 people from our quality team. After the certification:<br /><ul><li>We promote your work through a news on Open ERP</li><li>We tag your module as quality certified in the module list</li><li>We send you technical and functionnal feedback</li><li>We include it in maintenance contracts (for corporate contracts) or send you a yearly proposition for the maintenance of the module (migration to new versions, bugfixing, ...)</li></ul><br />It allows you to have a professional review on the quality of a module to avoid:<br /><ul><li>Complexities to migrate the module for futur version of Open ERP,</li><li>Having a module that do not fits Open ERP standards and is not used by the community,</li><li>Discovering bugs and problems once in production,</li><li>Queries that slows down the user interface when going on large production environment, etc.</li></ul><br />Once the quality of a module is certified, we offer second level maintenance contracts on this module to ensure module lifecycle during years, migration and bugfix guarantees.<br /><br />The advantage of using certified modules are:<br /><br /><ul><li>They are bugfree and the editor provides bugfix guarantee contracts,</li><li>You will not have migrations problems for next versions of Open ERP,</li><li>They are scallable and have been tested in production environments,</li><li>We made stress tests to check they run with big databases,</li><li>They are used by the community, so they will evolve and others will contribute.<br /></li></ul><br />The price to certify a module is 800 EUR, but we provide discounts for big projects, having lots of modules.  Note that you also have 25% discount on modules certification.<br /><br />Of course, that's not something you should buy. It's better to resell it<br />to the customer as a quality label.</div>

<h4><a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/openbravo-blogs/~3/lgLlYdDRyZI/">Asier Lostalé: New build process: keep it simple</a></h4>
<div class="entry">
<div >
<div class="snap_preview"><br /><h2>(Old) Problems</h2>
<p>For Openbravo ERP developers (specially for newcomers) it has always been difficult to decide which of the available build tasks was the best election to build the system after any development they had done. We had to take into account what modifications were done to know which ant task we should run. For example if we had modified a window we would use <em>ant compile -Dtab=myWindow </em>to generate the code just for that window and not for the rest of them.  It was even worse when working with subversion, each time we updated our working copy we had to look which were the files that had been updated to know if it was necessary to run <em>update.database </em>to synchronize Openbravo model database(database schema  objects and applicatoin dictionary data) from XML files. And in case there were modifications there it was worth re-generate all the WAD windows because it was difficult to know which ones had been modified. So many times <em>compile.complete</em> was the &#8220;safe&#8221; but slow choice.</p>
<p><em>Upadate.database</em> task had two more inconvenients: the first one was that in case Openbravo model was modified locally and not exported (<em>ant export.database</em>), when executing this task we would lose all the changes done in database for application dictionary. This annoying behavior had been reported as a <a href="https://issues.openbravo.com/view.php?id=6788">bug</a>. The other inconvenient was that during the r2.50 development cycle, specially because of the usage of <a href="http://wiki.openbravo.com/wiki/Projects/Data_Access_Layer">DAL</a> as part of the update process, this task was pretty unstable, making people not to be very confident about using it. As result people felt safer by recreating the whole system  (<em>ant install.source</em>) instead of executing a much faster incremental build (<em>ant update.database compile.complete</em>).</p>
<h2>New task: smartbuild</h2>
<p>For Openbravo ERP r2.50 we have resolved these problems by simplifying the <a href="http://wiki.openbravo.com/wiki/ERP/2.50/Development_tasks">build process</a> with a new incremental build task: <em>smartbuild, </em>which is currently available in trunk (r12753) and will be release in the next alpha (aplha r11)<em>.</em> This task performs all the required processes to build your  system but only the required ones, with a huge improvement in performance. It checks whether the database needs to be updated from xml sources and performs the update only if needed, generates the code that needs to be regenerated, compiles and deploys it.</p>
<p>The goal of this<em> smartbuild </em>is to replace most of the rest of tasks, making life a little simpler for developers. So now it is only needed to use two tasks: <em>smartbuild</em><em> </em>for all the builds and <em>export.database</em> to export database to xml files. <em>export.database </em>is now smart to export only if needed, skipping the process if no changes have happened in the local Openbravo model.</p>
<p>Moreover <em>update.database </em>ensures before updating that no local changes have occured in Openbravo model since the last synchronization (<em>export.database </em>or <em>update.database</em>) to prevent people loosing their changes. In case of changes, people will be required to export their database before updating it.</p>
<h2>How it works</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Determine if database needs to be updated. </strong>To do this <em>smartbuild</em> generates a checksum for the xml files and compares it with an existent one. This one is generated each time database is synchronized from xml files or to xml files. If the two checksums are different it means that xml files are different so database is updated.</li>
<li><strong>Decide which code needs to be re-generated. </strong>Whenever a build process is done a timestamp with the current time is stored in database. This timestamp is compared with the audit info for the application dictionary objects that participate in the code generation so now WAD is able to generate code only for those elements that have been created or modified after the last build. Additionally when exporting database to xml files the audit info is not longer exported and when updating the audit info is recalculated for the current time, thus it also works in case the modifications in application dictionary came from an <em>update.database. </em>There&#8217;s only one case when this check doesn&#8217;t work: it is when application dictionary elements are modified directly in databse through <em>insert/update </em>SQL statements without updating audit info. In this case the developer will have to generate the code in the old way (using <em>compile -Dtab=modifiedWindows</em>).</li>
<li><strong>Check if database has been changed. </strong>This check allows to export only if there&#8217;re changes in database and prevents data loses when updating database. To check this it is used the same timestamp as in the first point. Modifications in data are calculeted by DAL and modifications in database structure are queried directly to database. The query for database structure last modification has no problem in Oracle becuase <em>User_Objects</em> table stores the last physical change for each database object, but in PostgreSQL that information is not stored in database. This has been solved for PostgreSQL generating a checksum in database from all the elements in database that can be exported to xml files, that&#8217;s the reason why in PostgreSQL this check takes longer than in Oracle.</li>
</ul>

<h4><a href="http://fptiny.blogspot.com/2009/02/open-erp-v5-is-out.html">Open ERP v5 is out !</a></h4>
<div class="entry">
<div >
<p>That major enhancement of <b>Open ERP</b> can now answer to all the needs of a business. Open ERP V5 not only provides management functions, but also all functionalities necessary to a SMB, like : a process management by modules, a wiki, a webmail, a Business Intelligence (Cube OLAP),  a Document Management System, an eCommerce, an idea box, etc.</p>  <p>Emphasis was placed on an extreme simplification of the software for the new users, a carefully designed ergonomy of the web client with, amongst others, drag&amp;drop, Gantt graph, editable processes, etc., and more then 350 modules for specific sectors and big companies.</p>  <p>This new version comes with a full review of the web site giving access to more then 1500 pages of documentations on business management and a reorganisation of the community sources build upon the Open Object framework.
