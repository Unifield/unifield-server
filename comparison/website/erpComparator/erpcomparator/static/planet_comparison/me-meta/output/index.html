<h4><a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/openbravo-blogs/~3/HrqP_zQ1j1M/">Jordi Mas: Single Sign on launched for Openbravo Wiki and Openbravo Issues</a></h4>
<div class="entry">
<div >
Openbravo actually runs <a href="http://www.openbravo.com/">Openbravo.com</a>, <a href="http://issues.openbravo.com/">Openbravo Issues</a>, <a href="http://wiki.openbravo.com/">Openbravo Wiki</a>, <a href="http://planet.openbravo.com/">Openbravo Planet</a> and other web properties to provide services to the Openbravo ecosystem. Nowadays, you have to log individually to every service, which requires authentication. For example, you have to login in Mantis and to our Wiki separately since they work as separated systems. You also may use different usernames and passwords. This situation is going to get more complex as we introduce more web services that require authentication for a full user experience.<br /><br />To address this situation we have been working on a Single Sign-On solution based on CAS. This will allow users to have a single username and password for all Openbravo web site. More convenient yet, when you are authenticated in one Openbravo web sites you are automatically authenticated into the rest of other sites.<br /><br /><span>We are planning to enter into production of Single Sign-On in Openbravo web sites by 4th of February 20.00 GMT+1.</span><br /><br />Users affected with this migration will be notified by email with any required step that they have to perform. <br /><br />If you have any issue login into the systems, please let us know sending an email to migration@openbravo.com, specifying your name, the email you entered at the time of registration, the username that you usually employ, and the problem you are experiencing.<br /><br />Thanks for your support!<div class="feedflare">

<h4><a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/openbravo-blogs/~3/XJ9Mb4hnCDc/">Paolo Juvara: 2.50 status update and statistics</a></h4>
<div class="entry">
<div >
It has been 2 months since we launched 2.50 alpha and I would like to give you an update on our progress in the stabilization process.<br /><br />In short, it is taking longer than we expected and we still are finding many issues. As you might know from our wiki, our <a href="http://wiki.openbravo.com/wiki/DevelopmentProcess/Launch#Alpha_Release_Public_Testing">criteria for completing the alpha testing</a> and starting beta is to reach zero critical and major defects, and less than 100 minor and trivial defects combined.<br /><br />During 2.40, this process took us 8 weeks so we were expecting that it would have taken roughly the same amount of time for 2.50, but things are not going in the same way.<br /><br />We started the 2.40 alpha cycle on May 23, 2008 with an overall backlog of 278 open defects. In the 8 weeks till July 18th, when we published beta, 357 new defects were logged and we closed a total of 534, leaving the backlog level at 95 open defects, in line with our exit criteria. The historical trend is summarized in the image below.<br /><br /><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_1usNIc2hSIM/SYiRvJzLL0I/AAAAAAAAABI/TL4Tv4ZD93s/s1600-h/2_40HistoricalSummaryStatus.png"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_1usNIc2hSIM/SYiRvJzLL0I/AAAAAAAAABI/TL4Tv4ZD93s/s200/2_40HistoricalSummaryStatus.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5298645200871829314" border="0" /></a>When we started 2.50 alpha on the November 21st, we had a similar backlog of 271 product defects. However, since then and up to the end of January 2009, 646 defects have been reported and we have closed 684 defects, leaving the current backlog at 233.<br />The 2.50 historical trend is in the image below and as you can see, 10 weeks into the alpha cycle, the progress is very uncertain and we have been blocked at this level for a while.<br /><br /><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_1usNIc2hSIM/SYiR6cWfcGI/AAAAAAAAABQ/aHQABGafZlc/s1600-h/2_50HistoricalSummaryStatus.png"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_1usNIc2hSIM/SYiR6cWfcGI/AAAAAAAAABQ/aHQABGafZlc/s200/2_50HistoricalSummaryStatus.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5298645394830356578" border="0" /></a>How do we justify that? Have we been sleeping on the job? Actually, we made a lot of progress:<br /><ul><li>We fixed almost precisely the same number of defects per week in 2.50 as we did in 2.40 (68.4 defects per week in 2.50 vs. 66.7 defects per week in 2.40);</li><li>We published 9 alpha versions, both in source code format and in the handy appliance format to ease testing</li><li>We manned the Modularity Program that supports about 20 early adopters that are actively developing extensions on top of 2.50.<br /></li></ul>The thing is... the defect inflow has been 40% higher in 2.50 than in 2.40 (65 defects per week vs 45 defects per week) and this is what is slowing us down.<br /><br />But then... how do we explain this increase? I really do not have a very strong argument to explain it in definitive terms, but I can put forward some theories:<br /><ul><li>We do a much better job at testing compared to previous releases. In particular, compared to 2.40, our dedicated QA team has grown more than 300%</li><li>Our community usage of previous releases has grown dramatically in recent months and many users are stressing the systems in ways it was not stressed before. Of the 646 reported defects, 155 (or 24%) have been reported against a production release.<br /></li><li>Our community is testing this early release very actively: 2.50 alpha gets downloaded around 800 times a week (without even counting people who install from sources using our SVN repository) and around 10% of the defects are reported by community testers.<br /></li></ul>The complete explanation is probably a mix of all the above points.  Overall, this means that 2.50 is going to be the best release ever in terms of quality. Our exit criteria, in fact, is not time driven but quality driven and we will not release the beta version until the intended level of quality has been reached.<br /><br />Because we do not have a time boundary, it is difficult for us to predict the availability date of 2.50 beta. We hope that it is going to be within a few weeks but you can monitor the progress of our stabilization effort live: if you are an iGoogle user, <a href="http://www.google.com/ig/adde?moduleurl=bar-chart.xml&source=imag&up__table_query_url=https%253A%252F%252Fspreadsheets.google.com%252Ftq%253Frange%253DA1%25253AE100%2526headers%253D%252D1%2526key%253DpPWZAST9Jg5EFSVmSTz08Lw%2526gid%253D9&up_title=ERP+Defects&up_chartTitle=ERP+Defects&up_labelx=&up_labely=Date&up_legend=0&up_3d=0&up_stacked=1&up__table_query_refresh_interval=0">click here</a> to add a Google Gadget with daily update of our progress graph as in the image below.<br /><br /><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_1usNIc2hSIM/SYiQa0lkgsI/AAAAAAAAABA/ZjHfVTW6P00/s1600-h/iGoogle.png"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_1usNIc2hSIM/SYiQa0lkgsI/AAAAAAAAABA/ZjHfVTW6P00/s320/iGoogle.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5298643752068612802" border="0" /></a>You can help us in this process by contributing to the testing effort.
