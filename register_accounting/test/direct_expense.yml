  In order to test the Direct Expense, I create a cash register, I add an expense for a supplier and then I hard post the line. Finally I check that all lines were written and the move is reconciliated.
-
  I create a Cash Register with Opening and Closing balance 1000.
-
 !record {model: account.bank.statement, id: account_bank_statement_81}:
    date: !eval time.strftime('%Y-04-20')
    journal_id: account_journal_cash_0
    name: 
    period_id: period_4
    user_id: base.user_root
    starting_details_ids:
      -  pieces: 100.0
         number: 10
         subtotal: 1000.0
    balance_start: 1000.0
    balance_end: 1000.0
-
  I clicked on Open CashBox button to open the cashbox
-
 !python {model: account.bank.statement}: |
    self.button_open_cash(cr, uid, [ref("account_bank_statement_81")], {"lang": "en_US", "tz": False, "active_model": "account.bank.statement", \
        "active_ids": [ref("account_bank_statement_81")], "active_id": ref("account_bank_statement_81"), })
-
  I register a direct expense with the supplier "Local Miscellaneous" who's attached to a reconciliable 401 account.
-
  !record {model: account.bank.statement.line, id: account_bank_statement_line2}:
    statement_id: account_bank_statement_81
    account_id: account_account_expense0
    amount: -238.41
    date: !eval time.strftime('%Y-04-20')
    document_date: !eval time.strftime('%Y-04-20')
    name: Some water
    partner_id: res_partner_supplier_0
    sequence: 0.0
    type: general
-
  I hard post this line
-
  !python {model: account.bank.statement.line}: |
    self.button_hard_posting(cr, uid, [ref("account_bank_statement_line2")], context={'from_yml': True})
-
  I check that there is a move for this partner that has been reconciliated and have the same amount
-
  !python {model: account.move}: |
    res_ids = self.search(cr, uid, [('state', '=', 'posted'), ('name', '=', 'DirectExpense/Some water')])
    moves = self.browse(cr, uid, res_ids)
    for move in moves:
        for move_line in move.line_id:
            assert move_line.reconcile_id != False, "A line have not been reconciled!"
            assert move_line.partner_id.id == ref("res_partner_supplier_0"), "The supplier was not written correctly."
        assert move.amount == 238.41, "The amount don't correspond"
