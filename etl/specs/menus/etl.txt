				Input Component :
				    CSVFile Data Input Component 
                    ExcelFile Data Input Component (*)
                    XMLFile Data Input Component (*)
                    Open ERP module (*)
                    Open ERP MDX Cube Query (*)
                    Open ERP web-service
                    SQL Data

               Output Component :
                    CSVFile Data component
   -> ExcelFile Data Component (*)
   -> XMLFile Data Component (*)
   -> Open ERP module
   -> Open ERP web-service
   -> SQL Data

3) Object Data (Business Object):

   -> I don't think these are components to develop, it will be an Open eRP
      module that defines a job and several processes, on which you can connect
      using sub-process.

4) Process ETL Component :
    -> Sort process 
    -> Reverse Order process 
    -> Field Mapping Process (like tMap of Talend)
    -> Filtering Row Process
    -> Filtering Column process
    -> Diff (see prototype)
    -> Merge (see prototype)
    -> Search/Replace (from info in the component)
    -> Search/Replace (from another flow)
    -> Uniq Checks Process
    -> Apply/Validate Structure (using a meta data definition)
        -> Add fields (default value)
        -> Check fields (contraints, not null, ...)
    -> Python Code
    -> Fork Flow (duplicate the flow instead of passing 2 pointers)
    -> Split Flow (Conditional, send to different channels based on if)

5) Aggregate component 
    -> Aggregate (sum,avg aggredate function related)

6) Logger ETL Component :
    -> Data Log component (see prototype)
    -> Data Log bloc (log all at once, at the end, keep in memory) (see prototype)

7) Analysis Components (to be connected to a logger or other)
    -> Speed Tests (return a flow with speed results)
    -> Statistics on processed data

Terminology
-----------

A job is the definition of the job (like a workflow)

A process is a running job (like an instance of workflow)

A channel is a name on a transition. Components write data to channels.

A connector is the definition of the access on a database, file, ...
    A input/output component can use a connector.
